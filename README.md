## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### How I build

I create my repo on git hub. Then I copy the project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H/hub/qr-code-component-6t4kFprhG).
After reading the [README](./vendor/README.md), I open the JPG images of design on krita to calculate the different spacing design.
Then I build my html structure, and finally I write my css.

### What I learned

I learn how write a README file.
I've been some problem with collapsing margins, that was my first time and I saw that I can resolve the problem with something like that :

```css
#card {
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Useful resources
